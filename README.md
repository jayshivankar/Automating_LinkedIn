# LinkedIn Job Application Automation with Selenium

## Overview
This Python script automates the process of logging into LinkedIn, navigating to a specific job listing, and interacting with the job post by saving and following the company. The script uses Selenium WebDriver for automation.

   ```

3. Download and set up Chrome WebDriver:
   - Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
   - Extract the driver and place it in the script directory or set its path in your system variables.

## Usage

   ```python
   ACCOUNT_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
